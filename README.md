# simplified-Chinese-characters
This repo contains the images of 8105 simplified Chinese characters which I obtained from page 10-47 in "通用规范汉字表" (Table of General Standard Chinese Characters, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_General_Standard_Chinese_Characters), which was published by the PRC government in 2013.

The original document can be downloaded from:

While the character table can be found online, since there are some known problems about the digitalization of the table, I think it's potentially useful to have the table in its original form.
