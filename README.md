# simplified-Chinese-characters
This repo contains the images of 8105 simplified Chinese characters which I obtained from page 10-47 in "通用规范汉字表" (Table of General Standard Chinese Characters, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_General_Standard_Chinese_Characters), which was published by the PRC government in 2013.

The original document can be downloaded from:

While tables of simplified Chinese characters can be found online, there are some known issues with the digitalization of the table, for example, some characters in this table do not have properly created fonts. What is worse, not all characters in this table exist in unicode. I think it's useful to have the table in its original form as published.

Since it's published by the goverment, I think copyright of the images is not an issue. Take it if you wish.
